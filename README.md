## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) and a simple HTTP server. If you have Python installed, you can use its built-in HTTP server.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Serve the project locally**

    You can use any method to serve static files. Here are a couple of options:

    **Using Python (if installed)**

    If you have Python installed, you can use its built-in HTTP server. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory, then run:

    ```sh
    # For Python 3.x
    python -m http.server 8000

    # For Python 2.x
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
    ```

    This will start a server at `http://localhost:8000`.

    **Using Visual Studio Code Live Server**

    If you use Visual Studio Code, you can install the Live Server extension and open the project folder in VS Code. Click the "Go Live" button in the bottom right corner.

3. **Open your browser**

    Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser to view the login page.
